    <h3 class="section-title">The Problem with Traditional Chunking</h3>

    <p>
        Traditional RAG systems face several critical challenges that limit their effectiveness:
    </p>

    <h4>1. Semantic Fragmentation</h4>
    <p>
        Fixed-size chunking arbitrarily splits text without regard for meaning. A 1,000-character
        chunk may cut a sentence mid-word, separate a question from its answer, or combine
        unrelated paragraphs. This fragmentation confuses vector embeddings and reduces
        search accuracy.
    </p>

    <h4>2. Context Loss</h4>
    <p>
        When chunks are created in isolation, they lose the surrounding context that gives them
        meaning. A chunk describing "the system" provides no value if the reader doesn't know
        which system is being referenced.
    </p>

    <h4>3. Redundancy Explosion</h4>
    <p>
        Enterprise documents often contain the same information repeated across multiple files,
        versions, and formats. Traditional chunking preserves all this redundancy, creating
        massive vector databases full of duplicate content that:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Increases storage and compute costs</li>
        <li>Slows down vector search</li>
        <li>Returns redundant results to users</li>
        <li>Wastes LLM context window tokens</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4. Low Precision Retrieval</h4>
    <p>
        Because chunks often contain partial or mixed information, vector search frequently
        returns "close but not quite right" results. Users must sift through multiple chunks
        to piece together complete answers, and LLMs must process more context to find
        relevant information.
