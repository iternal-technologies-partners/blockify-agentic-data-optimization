        <p>Blockify is a data optimization tool that takes messy, unstructured text, like hundreds of sales-meeting transcripts or long proposals, and intelligently optimizes the data into small, easy-to-understand "IdeaBlocks." Each IdeaBlock is just a couple of sentences in length that capture one clear idea, plus a built-in contextualized question and answer.</p>

        <p>With this approach, Blockify improves accuracy of LLMs (Large Language Models) by an average aggregate 78X, while shrinking the original mountain of text to about 2.5% of its size while keeping (and even improving) the important information.</p>

        <p>When Blockify's IdeaBlocks are compared with the usual method of breaking text into equal-sized chunks, the results are dramatic. Answers pulled from the distilled IdeaBlocks are roughly 40X more accurate, and user searches return the right information about 52% more accurate. In short, Blockify lets you store less data, spend less on computing, and still get better answers- turning huge documents into a concise, high-quality knowledge base that anyone can search quickly.</p>

        <p>Blockify works by processing chunks of text to create structured data from an unstructured data source.</p>
