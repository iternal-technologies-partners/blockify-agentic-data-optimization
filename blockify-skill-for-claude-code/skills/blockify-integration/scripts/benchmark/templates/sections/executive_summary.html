    <p>
        Blockify<sup>&reg;</sup> is a patented knowledge distillation platform that transforms unstructured
        documents into semantically complete, self-contained units of knowledge called <strong>IdeaBlocks</strong>.
        Unlike traditional chunking methods that arbitrarily split text by character or token count, IdeaBlocks
        preserve the semantic integrity of information, ensuring that each unit answers exactly one question
        completely.

    <h4>Key Benefits</h4>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Higher Search Accuracy:</strong> IdeaBlocks are semantically complete, making vector search more accurate</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced Token Usage:</strong> Distilled content is smaller, reducing LLM context window requirements</li>
        <li><strong>Lower Costs:</strong> Fewer tokens means lower API costs and faster response times</li>
        <li><strong>Enterprise Scalability:</strong> Deduplication across documents eliminates redundancy at scale</li>
    </ul>
