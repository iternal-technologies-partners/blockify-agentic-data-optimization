    <h3 class="section-title">The Blockify<sup>&reg;</sup> Solution</h3>

    <p>
        Blockify<sup>&reg;</sup> solves these challenges through intelligent knowledge distillation:
    </p>

    <h4>1. Semantic Chunking</h4>
    <p>
        Instead of splitting by character count, Blockify<sup>&reg;</sup> uses LLMs to identify
        natural semantic boundaries. Each IdeaBlock represents a complete unit of knowledge
        that answers exactly one question—no more, no less.
    </p>

    <h4>2. Structured Extraction</h4>
    <p>
        Every IdeaBlock contains three key components:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Name:</strong> A descriptive title for the knowledge unit</li>
        <li><strong>Critical Question:</strong> The specific question this block answers</li>
        <li><strong>Trusted Answer:</strong> A complete, validated answer</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This structure ensures that embeddings capture the full semantic meaning and that
        retrieved content is immediately useful.
    </p>

    <h4>3. Enterprise Deduplication</h4>
    <p>
        Blockify<sup>&reg;</sup>'s distillation process identifies semantically similar IdeaBlocks
        across documents and merges them into single, authoritative versions. This eliminates
        the redundancy problem at its source, reducing database size while improving quality.
    </p>

    <h4>4. Optimized Retrieval</h4>
    <p>
        Because IdeaBlocks are semantically complete and deduplicated, vector search returns
        more accurate results with fewer candidates. LLMs receive cleaner context, enabling
        faster and more accurate responses.
