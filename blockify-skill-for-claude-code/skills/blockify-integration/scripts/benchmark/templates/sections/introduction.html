    <p>
        Blockify<sup>&reg;</sup> represents a paradigm shift in how organizations prepare their knowledge
        bases for AI-powered retrieval systems. Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems
        rely on naive chunking methods that split documents by arbitrary character or token counts,
        often breaking semantic units mid-thought and creating fragments that lack context.
    </p>

    <p>
        Blockify<sup>&reg;</sup> addresses these limitations through its patented knowledge distillation
        process, which uses fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Extract semantic units</strong> - Identify complete, self-contained pieces of knowledge</li>
        <li><strong>Generate critical questions</strong> - Formulate the question each unit answers</li>
        <li><strong>Validate trusted answers</strong> - Ensure answers are complete and accurate</li>
        <li><strong>Deduplicate across sources</strong> - Merge redundant information enterprise-wide</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The result is a knowledge base of <strong>IdeaBlocks</strong>—optimized, searchable units that
        dramatically improve both search accuracy and operational efficiency.
