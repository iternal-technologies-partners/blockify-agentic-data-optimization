# Transforming a County Government’s Back Office Paperwork with a 17X Efficiency Increase with AirgapAI on an AI PC

AI is rapidly becoming a strategic asset for leading county governments and their broad range of public-service departments. For The County Government Office, an essential entity supporting everything from community-event coordination to law-enforcement communications, manually drafting notices, summarizing ordinances, and reviewing budgets is slow, costly, and risks inconsistent results. Given the sensitive nature of citizen data, strict confidentiality requirements, evolving regulations, and the repercussions of publication delays, The County Government Office’s need for fast, accurate, and secure document insights has never been greater.

Together, Intel and Iternal Technologies have partnered to provide a unique on-premise solution that supports The County Government Office via AirgapAI, transforming public-facing document analysis. This ensures constituent information never leaves the county’s secure, on-premise environment.

The County Government Office can now confidently extract key actionable insights like ordinance changes, budget line items, and community-event details, significantly accelerating their citizen-engagement workflows.

### Benchmark Results

Running LLAMA 3.2 3B, an Intel AI PC can help draft new public-notice documents that total ≈2 pages (800 words) in ≈106 seconds, generating ≈1,060 tokens.

Assuming 30 minutes for a staff member to complete the same 2-page document set, including all data extraction, summarization, and template formatting (30 min), the AI can save approximately 0.47 hours (28 minutes) per document set, or 470 hours per year at a rate of 1,000 document sets per year.

* Tokens per Second: *10 \- 18* tokens per second  
* Average Tokens per Document Set: ≈*1,060* tokens  
* Time to Process a Document Set: ≈*2* minutes (automated)  
* Human Time to Process a Document Set: ≈30 minutes (legacy)  
* Public Notices / Ordinances to Process per Week: *40*\+

### Why GenAI for Government Document Analysis Matters & Why You Should Care

Deploying AI to evaluate thousands of pages of ordinances, budget reports, and community notices goes far beyond simple keyword searches. It requires extracting quality, accurate, and contextually relevant insights at scale, ensuring no sensitive data leaves your secure premises.

* For The County Government Office’s staff, data preparation and document information gathering have traditionally been a time-consuming process.  
* In the past, clerks would have to process thousands of government documents manually each year (a feat significantly limiting the office’s efficiency because of the cost and confidentiality concerns) to identify relevant statutes, budget allocations, and event details for each publication.  
* The highly complex and mentally taxing process of manually reviewing policy documents makes it hard to quickly identify and categorize funding changes, regulatory deadlines, or conflicting ordinance language.  
* Additionally, if a public notice fails to be published in time or contains errors, community programs may be delayed, leading to compliance penalties or lost public trust, which could introduce reputational risk and legal liabilities.  
* With hundreds of documents under management each month, the risk exposure from manual errors or delays can impact an entire county’s operations.

### Use Cases for County Government & Community-Engagement Teams

Some of the easiest solutions for county-government teams to deploy at scale, both quickly accelerating processing turnaround time and serving constituents, include:

* **Public Notice Draft Generation & Distribution:** Automatically extract key dates, locations, and instructions from source documents. AirgapAI surfaces the precise details, then produces a draft notice that can be dropped directly into the county’s publication platform. The County Government Office’s pilot showed near-instant processing, eliminating days of manual drafting.  
* **High-Quality Ordinance Summarization:** Create concise, citizen-friendly summaries of lengthy ordinances in seconds, designed to fill knowledge gaps and ensure comprehensive coverage of recent legislative changes.  
* **Meta-analysis of Budget Reports for Aggregate Insights:** Combine data from multiple departmental budgets to reveal spending trends, cost overruns, and savings opportunities. These insights guide proactive fiscal planning and streamline future budget cycles.  
* **Regulation Revision & Compliance Tracking:** Flag ordinances and internal policies that are approaching review dates or have conflicting language with current state or federal regulations. Automated alerts help teams stay ahead of audits and avoid compliance violations.  
* **Community-Event Content Generation:** Evaluate event proposals and automatically generate promotional content, FAQs, and safety guidelines tailored to diverse citizen groups, accelerating outreach and boosting attendance.

By automating what was once a heavily manual, error-prone workflow, The County Government Office meets tight publication deadlines, enhances public transparency, and maintains a consistently high level of data security and compliance.
