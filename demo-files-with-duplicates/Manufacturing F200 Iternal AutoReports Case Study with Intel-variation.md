## Enterprise-Scale Document Analysis and Automation — No Code Required

## The Problem: Document Analysis Doesn't Scale with Humans

Enterprises are drowning in documents. Legal contracts, security questionnaires, procurement proposals, regulatory filings, and compliance documentation pile up faster than teams can read them.

The manual approach breaks down at scale:
- **Bottlenecked throughput**: A lawyer spends 30-90 minutes reviewing a single contract — multiply that by thousands
- **Missed value**: Rebate clauses, renegotiation windows, and compliance deadlines buried in dense text go unnoticed
- **Inconsistent quality**: Human-dependent accuracy varies by analyst, fatigue level, and time pressure
- **Revenue risk**: Security questionnaires not returned on time kill deals; contracts renewed "as-is" lock in outdated terms
- **Impossible economics**: Reviewing 2 million pages manually requires tens of thousands of labor hours per month

**The result: critical insights stay buried, deadlines get missed, and organizations leave millions of dollars on the table.**

At this capacity, a single Gaudi 8X server can support the entire legal and procurement departments of The Manufacturing Company, saving countless hours of high-value staff time and reducing risk exposure in global operations.

## **The Business Value for GenAI for Supply Chain Contract Analysis**

Contracting in a global manufacturing giant like The Manufacturing Company is highly complex, spanning everything from raw materials sourcing to equipment leasing, logistics, warranties, and regulatory compliance. A single business unit handles countless agreements, attachments, exhibits, and compliance documents each year.

* **Manual Effort:** Historically, teams would sift through these contracts on a case-by-case basis, an extremely time-consuming process.  
* **Missed Opportunities:** Important clauses \- like volume discounts, compliance deadlines, or renegotiation windows \- could be overlooked, leading to additional costs or inefficiencies. They also require manual input into ERP systems.  
* **Risk Exposure:** Renewing contracts “as is” because a renegotiation window was missed can lock the company into outdated terms, which can add up to significant risk and increased cost over time.

By automating document ingestion, classification, and summarization, AutoReports gives The Manufacturing Company’s contract analysts a powerful new capability to identify, categorize, and act on critical contract details instantly.
