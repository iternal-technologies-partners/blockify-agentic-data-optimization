# **Transforming a Top 3 Pharmaceutical Company's Legal Contract Analysis with AutoReports: Saving Approximately 62,500 Hours a Year**

The challenge is clear: extract actionable intelligence from high-value legal documents at a scale that manual review cannot achieve. AI is rapidly becoming a strategic asset for major pharmaceutical organizations, and for one Top 3 Pharmaceutical Company, referred to in this case study as "The Pharma Company," analyzing legal contracts plays a critical role in maintaining competitive advantage.

Between complex rebate agreements, strict regulatory requirements, and the financial implications of contract terms, The Pharma Company's need for fast, accurate, and secure insights has never been greater. The volume of contracts is immense; the complexity is formidable; the cost of missed opportunities is substantial.

Together, Intel and Iternal Technologies have partnered to deliver a unique solution that supports one of the Top 3 Pharmaceutical Companies via the Turnkey AI platform and its no-code Generative AI document analysis solution, AutoReports, to transform legal contract analysis.

The Pharma Company can now confidently extract key actionable insights: rebate eligibility, rebate revenue potential, contract expiration dates, compliance requirements, and more.

## **Benchmark Results**

Running LLAMA 3.1 70B, an Intel Gaudi Server can process a legal contract that is 16 pages (3,068 words) in 20.88 seconds generating 478 tokens; or 8 pages (1,534 words) in 19.05 seconds generating 426 tokens. The ability to process approximately 2 million pages of text per month on a single Gaudi 2 core demonstrates the scalability and efficiency of this approach.

Assuming 30 minutes for a lawyer to complete the same 16-page contract review, the AI can save approximately 62,500 hours of effort processing 2 million pages a year.

* **Average Response Length in Tokens**: 452 tokens  
* **Response Time per Token**: 22.36 - 22.89 tokens per second  
* **Pages of Legal Text per Minute**: 45.9 pages  
* **Number of Contract Queries per Month**: 124,137 queries  
* **Total Legal Contract Pages Processed per Month**: 1,986,192 pages

At this capacity and scale, a single Gaudi 8X Server can provide enough capacity to support the entire legal department of The Pharma Company, saving the company thousands of hours of expensive billable legal hours.

## **Why GenAI for Contract Analysis Matters**

Deploying AI to evaluate thousands of pages of contracts, amendments, attachments, exhibits, and compliance documents goes far beyond simple data lookups. It requires extracting quality, accurate, and contextually relevant insights at scale.

The Pharma Company's contract analysts have traditionally faced a time-consuming process for data preparation and legal document information gathering. In the past, lawyers would have to sift through millions of contracts manually each year, a feat near impossible because of the cost, to identify opportunities for contract rebates, as well as other legal actions such as contract renewals and updating contract language for compliance upon renewal.

The highly complex and mentally taxing process of manually reviewing documents makes it hard to quickly identify and categorize contract terms, rebate thresholds, or expiration timelines. Additionally, if time runs out and a contract must either be cancelled or renewed as is because the window for renegotiation is missed, the contract may have to be renewed with old or outdated terms; this introduces risk and loss to the business.

With millions of legal contracts under management, the risk exposure can add up to hundreds of millions of dollars.

Leveraging the Turnkey AI platform and AutoReports, The Pharma Company can seamlessly ingest massive volumes of legal text from internal repositories, contract management systems, and even external websites. By using trusted information and a patented indexing approach, AutoReports helps analyze the long and complex legal documents through no-code workflows at millions scale, extract key insights, and makes it easy for legal teams to determine which contracts should be the highest priority to work on based on business value.

## **AutoReports In Action: A Summary of the Document Analysis Solution**

At its core, AutoReports streamlines unstructured text analysis by enabling users to quickly assemble no-code fully automated LLM workflows. The solution can ingest multiple data sources such as word documents, PDFs, TXT files, emails, and other media formats and then process those documents through a specific user-specified workflow, empowering The Pharma Company to extract and highlight critical legal contract details in minutes rather than hours or days.

### Ingestion and Optimization with Blockify

AutoReports uses Iternal's patented Blockify technology to break documents down into "IdeaBlocks" of verified content. These IdeaBlocks are rich with a robust metadata taxonomy containing information specific to the questions and information needed by the legal team. This approach improves retrieval speed, practically eliminates AI hallucinations, and boosts LLM accuracy by as much as 78x compared to traditional generative AI pipelines.

### AI-Driven Insights with AutoReports

Once documents have been "Blockified," AutoReports employs large language models to extract and identify key information such as rebate eligibility, rebate revenue estimates, compliance obligations, or approaching contract expiration dates.

Queries using AutoReports are fully configurable and can be deployed as LLM prompts via the Critical Question prompt field contained within each IdeaBlock.

AutoReports makes it easy for users to develop specialized queries using the IdeaBlocks to extract summaries and insights from the documents:

* What is the threshold and cap for liability and indemnification under this contract?  
* What are the formal names of legal entities party to the contract?  
* Does the contract have any rebate terms?  
* Are the rebate terms still active or eligible based on any expiration dates?  
* What products are eligible for rebate?  
* What are the criteria for the rebate terms?  
* Which contracts require compliance auditing in the next quarter?

Each query can be run in just a few seconds. Because the Turnkey AI platform running on Intel Gaudi supports "Bring Your Own Model," the AutoReports solution can plug and play the latest GenAI LLMs to process information with the highest degree of performance.

Additionally, because of how AutoReports processes insights at the IdeaBlock level, different parts of the AutoReport can tap into different LLMs; this means a document could be processed using one, two, three, or more unique LLMs, whether standard or fine-tuned, for even more specialized processing.
