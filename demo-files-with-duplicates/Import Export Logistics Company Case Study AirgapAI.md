# Transforming an Import/Export Company’s Invoice Processing with a 400% Speed Increase with AirgapAI on an AI PC

AI is rapidly becoming a strategic asset for leading logistics and customs import organizations. For The Import/Export Company, a key player in customs import and logistics for large manufacturers, manually processing invoices and extracting critical data is slow, costly, and risks inconsistent responses. Given the sensitive nature of customer information, strict confidentiality requirements, complex tariff regulations, and the financial implications of processing delays, The Import/Export Company's need for fast, accurate, and secure data insights has never been greater.

Together, Intel and Iternal Technologies have partnered to provide a unique on-premise solution that supports The Import/Export Company via AirgapAI, to transform invoice data analysis. This ensures valuable customer information never leaves The Import/Export Company's secure, on-premise environment.

The Import/Export Company can now confidently extract key actionable insights like invoice details, tariff classifications, and more, significantly accelerating their back-office order processing.

**Benchmark Results**

Running LLAMA 3.2 3B, an Intel AI PC can process a customs document (e.g., a bill of lading or commercial invoice) that is ≈4 pages (2,400 Words) in ≈310 seconds, generating ≈3,100 tokens. 

Assuming 25 minutes for a customs professional to complete the same 4 page document, including all data extraction and classification (25 min), the AI can save approximately 0.33 hours (20 minutes) per document, or 6,864 hours per year at a rate of 20,800 documents per year.

* Tokens per Second: 10-18 tokens per second  
* Average Tokens per Invoice: ≈3,100 tokens  
* Time to Process and Invoice: ≈5 minutes (automated)  
* Human Time to Process an Invoice: ≈25 minutes (legacy)  
* Shipments to Process per Week: 400+

**Why GenAI for Invoice Analysis Matters & Why You Should Care**

Deploying AI to evaluate thousands of pages of invoices, shipping manifests, and customs declarations goes far beyond simple data lookups. It requires extracting quality, accurate, and contextually relevant insights at scale, ensuring no sensitive data leaves your secure premises.

* For The Import/Export Company's back-office analysts, data preparation and document information gathering have traditionally been a time-consuming process.  
* In the past, analysts would have to process thousands of import/export documents manually each year (a feat significantly limiting the business’ growth because of the cost and confidentiality concerns) to identify opportunities for quickly mapping existing tariff codes with incoming invoices, as well as other actions such as updating declarations for compliance upon new regulations.  
* The highly complex and mentally taxing process of manually reviewing documents makes it hard to quickly identify and categorize product descriptions, tariff thresholds, or expiration timelines.  
* Additionally, if an invoice fails to be processed in time or contains errors, the shipment may be delayed, leading to demurrage charges or even lost contracts, which could introduce revenue risk and loss to the business.  
* With thousands of documents under management each month, the risk exposure from manual errors or delays can add up to hundreds of millions of dollars.

**Use Cases for Back-Office & Compliance Teams**

Some of the easiest solutions for back-office and compliance teams to deploy at scale, both quickly accelerating processing turnaround time and securing revenue, include:

* **Invoice Data Extraction and Draft Entry Generation:** Automatically align each line item on an invoice with the most relevant product description and tariff code. AirgapAI surfaces the precise details, then produces a draft entry that can be dropped directly into the customs declaration system. The Import/Export Company's pilot showed sub-second processing for batches of invoices, eliminating days of manual data entry.  
* **High-Quality Draft Customs Declaration Generation:** Create new draft customs declarations in seconds, designed to fill identified data gaps and ensure comprehensive coverage, adhering to the latest regulations.  
* **Meta-analysis of Invoices for Aggregate Insights:** Combine data from hundreds of processed invoices to reveal recurring product types, common classification challenges, and trending regulatory demands. These insights guide proactive tariff updates and streamline future responses.  
* **Regulation Revision & Tariff Tracking:** Flag internal customs documents that are approaching review dates or have conflicting language with current international trade requirements. Automated alerts help teams stay ahead of audits and avoid deal-blocking discrepancies, specifically related to tariff changes.  
* **Vendor Compliance & Eligibility Scoring:** Evaluate third-party vendor documentation against The Import/Export Company's own compliance baseline. The system scores each vendor's documentation, spotlighting high-risk suppliers and accelerating onboarding decisions.  
* **Risk Exposure Identification Across Documentation:** Extract potential vulnerabilities or non-compliance indicators from shipping manifests, commercial invoices, and customs policies. Consolidating these findings into a single dashboard gives leadership an enterprise-wide view of exposure in near real time, all without data leaving the premises.

By automating what was once a heavily manual, error-prone workflow, The Import/Export Company meets tight customer deadlines, preserves revenue, and maintains a consistently high level of data security and compliance.
