# **Transforming a Global Manufacturing Giant: Accelerating Supply Chain and Procurement through an AI-Enabled Workforce**

AI has become a critical competitive differentiator for global manufacturers. For one Fortune 200 Manufacturing Company, in this case study referred to as “The Manufacturing Company,” managing high-volume supplier contracts and materials agreements, supply chain resource allocation, and revenue generating rebates is highly complex. The Manufacturing Company’s business units operate in an environment where accurate, fast, and secure data analysis isn’t just nice to have, it’s essential.

Traditional solutions require an unaffordable amount of man power and are often siloed, slow to adapt, and limited in actionable insights. Iternal Technologies, in partnership with Intel’s advanced Gaudi AI infrastructure, is delivering a comprehensive solution that enables manufacturing organizations to scale through the power of Generative AI.

From optimizing the supply chain and procurement pipelines to empowering employees with AI-driven decision-making, Iternal’s Turnkey AI platform, featuring AutoReports, Nebulous™, Blockify®, and AirgapAI™, is redefining the way manufacturing giants can work smarter and faster at scale.

## **Benchmark Results**

Running LLAMA 3.1 70B on an Intel Gaudi Server, AutoReports can process a 12-page (3,003-word) supplier or vendor agreement in just under 15.85 seconds (generating 426 tokens), or a 9-page document (2,406 words) in about 15.48 seconds (399 tokens). At near real-time speeds, a single Gaudi 2 core can process roughly 2 million pages of text per month.

In a manual workflow, contract specialists may spend upwards of 22.5 minutes reviewing a typical 12-page agreement. Replacing some of those steps with AI yields a savings of around 62,500 hours annually when scaling to 2 million pages. The impact on speed, throughput, and cost is game-changing for The Manufacturing Company’s global teams, who juggle thousands of active contracts at any given moment.

* **Average Response Length in Tokens:** ≈412.5  
* **Response Time per Token:** 26.33 tokens/second  
* **Pages of Legal or Technical Text per Minute:** ≈45.96  
* **Typical Contract Queries per Month:** ≈166,000  
* **Total Contract Pages Processed per Month:** ≈1,985,472

At this capacity, a single Gaudi 8X server can support the entire legal and procurement departments of The Manufacturing Company, saving countless hours of high-value staff time and reducing risk exposure in global operations.

## **The Business Value for GenAI for Supply Chain Contract Analysis**

Contracting in a global manufacturing giant like The Manufacturing Company is highly complex, spanning everything from raw materials sourcing to equipment leasing, logistics, warranties, and regulatory compliance. A single business unit handles countless agreements, attachments, exhibits, and compliance documents each year.

* **Manual Effort:** Historically, teams would sift through these contracts on a case-by-case basis, an extremely time-consuming process.  
* **Missed Opportunities:** Important clauses \- like volume discounts, compliance deadlines, or renegotiation windows \- could be overlooked, leading to additional costs or inefficiencies. They also require manual input into ERP systems.  
* **Risk Exposure:** Renewing contracts “as is” because a renegotiation window was missed can lock the company into outdated terms, which can add up to significant risk and increased cost over time.

By automating document ingestion, classification, and summarization, AutoReports gives The Manufacturing Company’s contract analysts a powerful new capability to identify, categorize, and act on critical contract details instantly.

## **Iternal’s Turnkey AI In Action**

Iternal’s Turnkey AI platform offers a suite of solutions that span use cases across every department of an organization. 

### **Ingestion and Optimization with Blockify®**

Iternal’s patented Blockify technology to ingests and distills information from documents into “IdeaBlocks,” pieces of verified content enriched with metadata taxonomies that match The Manufacturing Company’s sales, marketing, education, supply chain, legal, and compliance needs. This approach dramatically reduces inaccurate AI inferences (hallucinations) by as much as 78X (7,800%) versus traditional text-parsing pipelines. Guaranteed structured data indexing means employees trust the AI’s recommendations \- critical for high-stakes negotiations or technical validations.

Blockify also enables consistent & Trusted Insights by eliminating duplicated or conflict-prone text, reducing confusion and ensures a single source of truth; perfect for merging large catalogs of engineering specs, compliance mandates, or supplier contracts.

### **AI-Driven Insights with AutoReports**

AutoReports empowers non-technical users to interact with a no-code interface that ingests and processes contracts at massive scale \- Word docs, PDFs, TXT files, or emails. Within minutes, The Manufacturing Company’s teams can highlight the critical terms and obligations that matter the most.

Imagine a busy contract specialist buried under a stack of 16-page supplier agreements \- a task that used to take over 30 minutes per document. With AutoReports™, that same dense contract is ingested and transformed into an actionable summary in under 21 seconds. 

Across millions of pages, what once consumed countless hours now happens almost instantly. AutoReports™ doesn’t simply digitize documents; it understands them. 

By automatically parsing key terms such as payment schedules, rebate opportunities, penalty clauses, and renegotiation windows, it empowers teams to shift from reactive paperwork skirmishes to proactive business strategy sessions.

Once all documents are “Blockified,” large language models identify specific requests defined by the users such as warranty terms, performance metrics, or product codes. Specialized prompts can quickly reveal:

* Payment due dates or penalty schedules under a supplier agreement  
* Whether a contract includes price-break clauses for large volumes  
* Potential performance or compliance audits required in the next quarter  
* Which contracts allow for renegotiation or mid-term amendments

With Turnkey AI’s “Bring Your Own Model” approach on Intel Gaudi, The Manufacturing Company can integrate the latest GenAI LLMs and fine-tune them for even more specialized use cases in different global markets.

AutoReports can also be used for:

* **RFP/RFI Vendor Submission Review**  
  * Vendor evaluation and selection from an RFI or RFP process  
  * Ideal for quickly sizing up vendor proposals, identifying hidden cost efficiencies, or ensuring compliance with global regulations.  
* **Bulk Contract Analysis**   
  * Automate the ingestion of legal documents, procurement proposals, or engineering specifications.  
  * Extract only the key elements \- prices, terms, compliance requirements \- turning thousands of pages into an actionable summary in minutes.  
* **Enhanced Decision Speed & Accuracy**  
  * Move from days or weeks of manual review to near real-time insights.  
  * Significantly reduce reliance on costly, error-prone manual analysis and let teams focus on higher-value tasks such as strategy and relationships.

### **Nebulous™: Outcome-Driven Prioritization**

In a sprawling enterprise where critical tasks pressure every moment of the day, keeping teams focused on high-value tasks is a constant challenge. 

Nebulous™, an first of its kind, outcome-driven prioritization engine that brings clarity to complexity. By dynamically ranking tasks based on robust, real-time metrics, Nebulous™ ensures that the most urgent and impactful activities \- whether it’s alerting teams about upcoming contract renewals or flagging potential supply chain disruptions \- always rise to the top. ![][image4]

In a global organization, even a minor shift in priority can ripple across multiple departments, and Nebulous™ makes sure that those ripples translate into focused, strategic action without the guesswork typical of traditional management.

Powered by Intel Gaudi for LLM analysis, Nebulous enables task ingestion to become automated, allowing users to quickly align tasks and priorities and find “diamond in the rough” opportunities for optimal ROI.
