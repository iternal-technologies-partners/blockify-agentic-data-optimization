# Transforming a County Government HR Department’s Policy & Procedure Support with a 10X Speed Increase with AirgapAI on an AI PC

AI is rapidly becoming a strategic asset for forward-thinking county governments and their human-resources and citizen-engagement operations. For The County Government HR Department, the backbone of employee enablement and the first line of support over one thousand county workers, manually locating policies, answering procedural questions, and drafting official responses is slow, costly, and risks inconsistent guidance. Given the sensitive nature of personnel records, strict confidentiality requirements, constantly evolving labor regulations, and the repercussions of delayed answers, The County Government HR Department’s need for fast, accurate, and secure information retrieval has never been greater.

Together, Intel and Iternal Technologies have partnered to provide a unique on-premise solution that supports The County Government HR Department via AirgapAI, transforming policy and procedure analysis. This ensures employee data and citizen inquiries never leave the county’s secure, on-premise environment.

The County Government HR Department can now confidently extract key actionable insights like policy clauses, benefit eligibility, and procedural checklists, significantly accelerating their employee-support and citizen-service workflows.

**Benchmark Results**

Running LLAMA 3.2 3B, an Intel AI PC with Blockify for 78X AI Accuracy can process an HR policy handbook excerpt that is ≈ 25 pages (10,000 words) in ≈ 600 seconds, generating ≈7,200 tokens for optimizing AI Search and achieving a 7,800% improvement in accuracy.

Assuming 90 minutes for an HR specialist to locate, interpret, and respond to the same policy question manually, the AI can save approximately 1.75 hours (105 minutes) per inquiry, or 15,288 hours per year at a rate of 8,736 inquiries per year (≈ 168 per week).

* Tokens per Second: 10-18 tokens per second  
* Average Tokens per Inquiry: ≈ 7,200 tokens  
* Time to Process a Policy Inquiry: ≈ 10 minutes (automated)  
* Human Time to Process a Policy Inquiry: ≈ 90 minutes (legacy)  
* Employee & Citizen Inquiries per Week: 168+

**Why GenAI for HR Policy & Citizen Support Analysis Matters & Why You Should Care**

Deploying AI to evaluate thousands of pages of employee handbooks, labor contracts, ordinances, and citizen-service guidelines goes far beyond simple keyword searches. It requires extracting quality, accurate, and contextually relevant insights at scale, ensuring no sensitive data leaves your secure premises.

* For The County Government HR Department’s staff, data preparation and document retrieval have traditionally been a time-consuming process.  
* In the past, employees would have to sift through extensive HR manuals, union contracts, and procedural memos manually each year (a feat significantly limiting the department’s responsiveness because of the cost and confidentiality concerns) to answer day-to-day questions about benefits, leave policies, or citizen requests for services.  
* The highly complex and mentally taxing process of manually reviewing policy documents makes it hard to quickly identify and categorize eligibility criteria, filing deadlines, or conflicting clauses.  
* Additionally, if a policy response fails to be delivered in time or contains errors, employee morale may suffer, grievances can escalate, and compliance penalties could follow, introducing financial and reputational risk.  
* With thousands of inquiries under management each month, the risk exposure from manual errors or delays can ripple across every county department.

**Use Cases for HR & Administrative Teams**

Some of the easiest solutions for HR and administrative teams to deploy at scale, both quickly accelerating response turnaround time and improving constituent satisfaction, include:

* **Policy Inquiry Resolution & Draft Response Generation:** Automatically locate relevant sections across multiple documents (handbooks, contracts, ordinances), surface the precise language, then produce a draft email or memo that can be sent directly to the inquiring employee or citizen. The County Government’s use case eliminated hours of manual document hunting.  
* **Employee Onboarding Packet Personalization:** Generate tailored onboarding packets in seconds, aligning role-specific policies, benefit selections, and mandatory training schedules without exposing sensitive data to external systems.  
* **Regulation & Contract Clause Summarization:** Quickly summarize complex labor-contract clauses or newly adopted ordinances into plain-language briefs, ensuring that managers and frontline staff understand their obligations.  
* **Policy Gap Analysis & Revision Drafting:** Compare existing policies against updated state or federal labor regulations, flag discrepancies, and draft revision proposals, helping the county stay audit-ready.  
* **Citizen Request Triage & Knowledge-Base Enhancement:** Analyze citizen support tickets, auto-classify the request type, suggest next steps, and update internal FAQs, reducing call-center load and accelerating issue resolution.  
* **Risk Exposure Identification Across Documentation:** Extract potential compliance vulnerabilities, outdated procedures, or conflicting guidelines across HR, finance, and public-safety documents. Consolidating these findings into a single dashboard gives leadership an enterprise-wide view of exposure in near real time, all without data leaving the premises.

By automating what was once a heavily manual, error-prone workflow, The County Government HR Department meets tight response deadlines, strengthens employee confidence, improves citizen satisfaction, and maintains a consistently high level of data security and compliance.
