## The Problem: AI Literacy Is Holding Back Enterprise Adoption

Enterprises are ready to invest in AI. The technology exists. The hardware is capable. Yet adoption stalls at one critical barrier: **employees don't know how to talk to AI**.

Research shows that over 50% of the workforce has zero experience with AI prompting, and only 33% possess any detailed knowledge of how to craft effective prompts. The result is predictable: expensive AI tools sit unused, productivity gains never materialize, and organizations struggle to justify continued investment.

The gap isn't technology. It's the **human-AI interface**.

---

## The Solution: 2,800+ Pre-Built Quick Start Workflows

AirgapAI ships with **2,800+ pre-built, enterprise-ready workflows** that remove prompt engineering from the equation entirely. Each workflow is a pre-configured AI task designed by experts, optimized for specific business outcomes, and ready to execute with a single click.

**No training required. No prompt expertise needed. Day-one productivity.**

---

## How Quick Start Workflows Work

Workflows appear as buttons directly in the AirgapAI chat interface:

| Step | User Action | What Happens |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | Click a workflow button (e.g., "Create Social Media Post") | Pre-engineered prompt loads automatically |
| 2 | Upload or paste your input (document, data, context) | AI receives structured guidance on exactly what to produce |
| 3 | Receive expert-quality output | Results match what a skilled prompt engineer would generate |

**Example**: A user clicks "Create Social Media Post," uploads a 10-page case study, and types only "make post." Despite the minimal input, the output is a viral-themed LinkedIn post with hashtags, emojis, and engagement hooks because the workflow's pre-configured prompt engineering handles everything behind the scenes.

## **Why AI Inference Matters and Why You Should Care**

AI inference is more than running a trained model; it goes beyond simple document search. It empowers proposal, capture, and engineering teams to extract real-time, accurate, and contextually relevant insights from decades of classified program data at scale.

Traditional proposal efforts require manual content mining across countless repositories. Without an AI-driven content-lifecycle approach, Defense Contractors risk delays, non-compliant language, or inadvertent disclosure of controlled information. Garbage in, garbage out \- and if you can’t trust your AI every time, you can’t trust it at all.

![][image1]

Intel and Iternal used AI to bring structure to unstructured documents: historical proposals, CDRLs, CONOPS, cyber-security annexes, hardware drawings, software bill-of-materials, and test reports, through an advanced data-ingestion and optimization approach powered by Blockify.

![][image2]

The result is a single source of truth distilled to only 2.5 percent of its original size \- easier to govern, quicker to query, and fully aligned to export-control rules.

## **A Summary of the AI Inference Solution**

### Blockify Data Ingestion with Gaudi

Leveraging Intel Gaudi 2 AI accelerators and Iternal’s patented Blockify solution, Major Defense Contractor teams can ingest and optimize thousands of documents for an improved large-language-model inferencing pipeline paired with RAG.

* Processing Speed: ≈ 900 words / sec  
* Accuracy: RAG-based LLM accuracy ↑ 40×; vector search precision ↑ 51 %  
* Inference Throughput: 0.68 inferences / sec (≈ 5,404 bytes / sec)

Blockify’s three-pronged ingestion, distillation, and taxonomy workflow:

* Ingestion & De-duplication \- eliminate redundant clauses, legacy specs, and obsolete standards.  
* Distillation \- segment content into modular “blocks” tagged with classification, ITAR, and export-control attributes.  
* Taxonomy Creation \- index every block for dynamic contextual retrieval inside the SCIF.

### AirgapAI – Inferencing at the Edge with Intel NPU

Optimizing data is only useful when applied in the field. AirgapAI is a powerful, network-independent AI solution designed to run locally on Intel-equipped AI PCs inside a SCIF \- no external connectivity required.

* Vector Search & Inference: ≈ 2.2× faster on Intel NPU  
* Accuracy: RAG-based LLM accuracy ↑ 40×; vector search precision ↑ 51 %  
* Retrieval: Scan ≈ 10 million records in \< 1.5 sec

After Blockify outputs the distilled dataset, engineers load it onto an AirgapAI-enabled workstation. The system retrieves relevant content and launches an LLM inference to draft compliance-checked sections, technical descriptions, or responses to Contracting Officer questions \- all fully offline, ensuring NISPOM, CMMC, and ITAR compliance.

By operating completely offline, AirgapAI upholds stringent data-protection standards, no external connection is required, minimizing potential vulnerabilities and ensuring confidential information remains strictly private. 

## **Eliminating Legacy RAG Pitfalls**

One of the primary issues with legacy RAG is the semantic drift between how unique donor questions are represented in vector space, compounded by vector dilution when extraneous details pollute a chunk of text. Blockify eliminates these issues by delivering a 51 percent improvement in vector accuracy and by embedding a dedicated query element that guides retrieval toward the most appropriate content.

![][image3]

## **What We Did: Breaking Down the Framework**

Intel Gaudi 2 accelerates LLM inference with high-throughput deep-learning cores, ideal for parallel processing of complex, multi-tiered defense documentation. Major Defense Contractor's documents often contain nested specifications and acronym-heavy language. To enable real-time Q\&A, content was modularized with Blockify, then embedded as high-density vectors for instantaneous retrieval.

LLAMA 3, fine-tuned via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a single Gaudi 2 core, achieved optimal quality by processing 8,000-character segments and generating 1,000 tokens per response with 100 parallel jobs.

### The Blockify workflow steps included:

1. Chunking the Text: The source documents were divided into smaller content chunks based on a proprietary algorithm. Those chunks were passed into the specially configured LLM, which output modular blocks of content. These blocks offer a robust taxonomy that can be reused or reassembled based on user needs.

![][image4]

2. Embeddings: These content blocks were converted into embeddings (vector representations) to capture unique context and structure, enabling content-aware retrieval within AirgapAI.  
3. Retrieval and Response Generation: Based on user queries, the system retrieves relevant content from the Context-Aware Retrieval Database for accurate, contextually relevant responses.

This enhanced workflow allows the system to instantly recall specific insights, marketing strategies, service offerings, and proposals, with the ability to dynamically assemble content into diverse structured outputs using large language models.

The result? Real-time expertise, engagement, and personalized content in minutes \- something that would otherwise require hours of manual research and compilation.

## **Business Use Cases: Real-Time AI Inference in Action**

* Classified Proposal Generation \- assemble RFP volumes, SOW mappings, and BOE narratives in minutes while ensuring DD-254 classification rules are met.  
* Engineering Change Requests \- auto-populate ECP templates with lineage-tracked subsystem specs and cost impacts.  
* Capability Statements & Data Sheets \- produce ITAR-sanitized marketing collateral for FMS programs without exposing source data.   
* SCIF FAQ Assistant \- field real-time questions from program managers on power budgets, SWaP-C metrics, or MIL-STD compliance entirely offline.  
* Test Procedure Authoring \- draft qualification test plans referencing historical vibration or EMI results in seconds.

### What This Means for You: Scalable AI Inference for Future Growth

By uniting Intel Gaudi 2 and Iternal Technologies’ Blockify with the secure, offline capabilities of AirgapAI, defense contractors can harness AI inference at scale, turning decades of unstructured advancement data into actionable insights without ever exposing sensitive information to third-party clouds. With Intel Gaudi 2, Blockify, and AirgapAI, Major Defense Contractor can:

* Automate Data Ingestion & Curation \- process terabytes of legacy documentation while slashing hallucinations.  
* Drive Hyper-Compliant Content \- ensure every generated paragraph respects classification, ITAR, and customer-flow-down clauses.  
* Accelerate Decision-Making \- surface trusted answers in seconds, compressing proposal cycles and boosting Pwin (Proposal Win Probability).  
* Protect National Security \- keep all sensitive data inside the SCIF, eliminating cloud-based exposure risks.

AI has moved from conceptual to operational in defense contracting. Whether generating a rapid-response proposal, answering contracting-officer inquiries, or drafting engineering artifacts, Intel and Iternal deliver the secure, accurate, and scalable framework Major Defense Contractor needs to maintain mission advantage.
