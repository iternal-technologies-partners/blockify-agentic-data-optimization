# Transforming a County Clerk’s Case Brief Preparation 4.3X Faster with AirgapAI on an AI PC

AI is rapidly becoming a strategic asset for leading county clerk offices and law enforcement agencies. For The County Clerk’s Office, a pivotal organization supporting local courts and police departments, manually preparing case briefs and extracting critical facts is slow, costly, and risks inconsistent results. Given the sensitive nature of criminal evidence, strict confidentiality requirements, evolving legal statutes, and the repercussions of filing delays, The County Clerk’s Office’s need for fast, accurate, and secure document insights has never been greater.

Together, Intel and Iternal Technologies have partnered to provide a unique on-premise solution that supports The County Clerk’s Office via AirgapAI, transforming legal document analysis. This ensures sensitive records never leave The County Clerk’s secure, on-premise environment.

The County Clerk’s Office can now confidently extract key actionable insights like charge descriptions, witness statements, and relevant precedents, significantly accelerating their court-ready case brief preparation.

### Benchmark Results

Running LLAMA 3.2 3B, an Intel AI PC can process a criminal case file that is 100 pages (40,000 Words) in 1.4 hours, generating 50,000 tokens.

Assuming 6 hours for a clerk to complete the same 100 page case brief, including all data extraction and summarization (360 min), the AI can save approximately 4.6 hours (276 minutes) per brief, or 239.2 hours per year at a rate of 52 briefs per year.

* Tokens per Second: 10-18 tokens per second  
* Average Tokens per Brief: ≈50,000 tokens  
* Time to Process a Brief: ≈84 minutes (automated)  
* Human Time to Process a Brief: ≈360 minutes (legacy)  
* Case Briefs to Process per Week: 1+

### Why GenAI for Case Brief Analysis Matters & Why You Should Care

Deploying AI to evaluate thousands of pages of police reports, witness statements, and prior rulings goes far beyond simple keyword searches. It requires extracting quality, accurate, and contextually relevant insights at scale, ensuring no sensitive data leaves your secure premises or breaks the chain of custody.

* For The County Clerk’s research staff, data preparation and document gathering have traditionally been a time-consuming process.  
* In the past, clerks would have to process tens of thousands of court documents manually each year (a feat significantly limiting the office’s efficiency because of the cost and confidentiality concerns) to identify relevant statutes, precedent, and evidence summaries for each brief.  
* The highly complex and mentally taxing process of manually reviewing legal documents makes it hard to quickly identify and categorize charges, deadlines, or conflicting testimonies.  
* Additionally, if a case brief fails to be completed in time or contains errors, court proceedings may be delayed, leading to dismissed charges or appeals, which could introduce public-safety risks and legal liabilities.  
* With numerous cases under management each year, the risk exposure from manual errors or delays can impact the entire criminal-justice workflow.

### Use Cases for County Clerk & Law Enforcement Teams

Some of the easiest solutions for county clerk and law-enforcement teams to deploy at scale, both quickly accelerating processing turnaround time and protecting public safety, include:

* **Case Brief Data Extraction and Draft Generation:** Automatically align each piece of evidence with the most relevant statute or precedent. AirgapAI surfaces the precise details, then produces a draft case brief that can be dropped directly into the court filing system. The County Clerk’s pilot showed sub-second processing for batches of reports, eliminating days of manual summarization.  
* **High-Quality Draft Motion Preparation:** Create new draft motions in seconds, designed to fill identified data gaps and ensure comprehensive coverage, adhering to the latest case law.  
* **Meta-analysis of Case Files for Aggregate Insights:** Combine data from hundreds of processed cases to reveal recurring crime patterns, frequent procedural challenges, and trending judicial decisions. These insights guide proactive policy updates and streamline future responses.  
* **Statute Revision & Compliance Tracking:** Flag internal legal documents that are approaching revision dates or have conflicting language with current legislation. Automated alerts help teams stay ahead of audits and avoid case-blocking discrepancies.  
* **Witness Statement Consistency Scoring:** Evaluate multiple witness statements against the established fact baseline. The system scores each statement’s consistency, spotlighting high-risk discrepancies and accelerating investigative follow-ups.  
* **Risk Exposure Identification Across Documentation:** Extract potential vulnerabilities or non-compliance indicators from arrest reports, affidavits, and court orders. Consolidating these findings into a single dashboard gives leadership an enterprise-wide view of exposure in near real time, all without data leaving the premises.

By automating what was once a heavily manual, error-prone workflow, The County Clerk’s Office meets tight court deadlines, upholds justice, and maintains a consistently high level of data security and compliance.
